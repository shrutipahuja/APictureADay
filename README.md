# APOD (Astronomy Picture of the Day)

This application lets users browse through images parsed from NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day. 

Each image has a title, date, image url, etc.

APOD has two screens:

<b>Screen 1: APOD Grid Screen</b>

This screen displays the images created in a reverse chronological order in a grid like scrollable list.

When any image is clicked, the user is redirected to the Image Details Screen.

<b>Screen 2: Image Details Screen</b>

This screen is launched  when the user clicks on the image from the Images Grid screen.

This is a static screen which displays the image, image title, image explanation and the date stamp when the image was created.
